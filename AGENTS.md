# Fooino Skeleton

Skeleton foundational library for the Fooino ecosystem

**Critical foundation package.** All other fooino packages and projects depend on this library. Every function, class, and helper must be written with extreme care — edge cases, input validation, type safety, and predictability are non-negotiable. A bug here cascades everywhere.

## Project Architecture

Source code lives under `src/`. File placement is determined by content, not by guessing:

| Directory | When to place a file here |
|---|---|
| `src/Interfaces/` | Defining a contract/abstraction. Name must end with `able` (e.g., `Jsonable`, `Mathable`). |
| `src/Concretes/` | Implementing an interface or providing a concrete service. Group by domain in subdirectories (e.g., `Concretes/Math/`). |
| `src/Facades/` | Creating a Laravel facade. Must extend `Illuminate\Support\Facades\Facade`. |
| `src/Exceptions/` | Creating an exception. Must extend `Fooino\Core\Exceptions\FooinoException`. |
| `src/Providers/` | Service providers. Must extend `Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider`. |
| `src/Support/` | Utility/helper classes that don't implement a domain interface (e.g., `Sanitizer`, `TokenGenerator`). |
| `src/Enums/` | PHP native enums only. |
| `src/Concerns/` | Traits only. |
| `tests/Unit/` | Pest tests. One test file per source class. |
| `docs/markdown/` | Documentation files. Domain docs and reference files. |

Global functions go in `src/helpers.php`, each wrapped in `if (!function_exists(...))`. Constants go in `src/helpers.php` guarded by `if (!defined(...))`.

**Architecture is enforced** by `tests/Unit/ArchitectureUnitTest.php` — any new file must pass these structural assertions.

## Coding Standards & Design Patterns

### Philosophy
Follow **SOLID** and **KISS** principles. Methods must have a **single responsibility** and be small. Write ninja code — concise but never obscure. Maintainability and readability are paramount.

### Method & Variable Naming
- Methods use `camelCase`. Variables use `camelCase`.
- Private/protected properties use `camelCase`.
- Constants use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.
- Boolean methods imply a question: `isJson()`, `greaterThan()`, `notEqual()`.
- Getter/setter convention: `getPrecision()` / `setPrecision()`.

### Type Declarations
- **Every** method parameter and return type must be explicitly typed (PHP 8.x union types used extensively).
- Never use `mixed` as a lazy escape — only when types genuinely vary.
- Interface methods carry full `@param`/`@return` phpDocs; concrete implementations may omit `@param`/`@return` if the signature is self-documenting.

### phpDoc
- **Every method must have a phpDoc description.** The description explains **why**, not how. Keep it one line.
- Example: `/** Retrieve the current precision value used for truncating output numbers */` — not "Returns the precision property".

### Method Size & Responsibility
- Each method does one thing. If a method needs a multi-paragraph phpDoc to explain what it does, it does too much. Split it.
- Private helper methods are encouraged to keep public methods lean.

### Fluent Interfaces
- Setters and config methods return `static` to enable chaining.
- The exception system uses fluent method chaining: `app(Exception::class)->_CODE()->with([])->throw()`.

### Named Arguments
- Always use named arguments when calling methods: `app(SomeClass::class)->someMethod(operand: [1, 2])`, not `app(SomeClass::class)->someMethod([1, 2])`.

## Error Code Ranges

All errors use the fluent exception system built on `Fooino\Core\Exceptions\FooinoException`. Error methods (`_XXXX()`) are defined directly on each exception class.

| Range | Exception Class | Domain |
|---|---|---|
| `1–249` | `Fooino\Core\Exceptions\FooinoRuntimeException` | General runtime errors |
| `250–499` | `Fooino\Core\Exceptions\InfiniteLoopException` | Infinite loop / recursion protection |

When adding a new error, pick the next unused code in the appropriate range, add an `_XXXX()` method to the corresponding exception class, and follow the existing pattern: set message key, code, level, and reportable flag via fluent chain.

## Testing Conventions

- **Framework**: Pest PHP with Orchestra Testbench.
- **Architecture tests**: `tests/Unit/ArchitectureUnitTest.php` enforces structural rules (directories contain correct types, no debug calls, every method documented).
- **Data providers**: Static methods in `tests/Data/Datasets.php`.
- **Naming**: Test methods use descriptive lowercase strings: `test('precision getter and setter', function () { ... })`.
- **Coverage requirements**: Code coverage AND type coverage must both stay above **90%**. Every new or changed source line must have a corresponding test. Do not ship untested code.
- **Run tests with**: `composer pest` or `./vendor/bin/pest`.
